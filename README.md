## FAQs
1. Q. "Why should I use Markdown instead of a general word processor?"

   A. Markdown allows a user to separate the content and style of their document. Using Markdown lets a user apply many different styles to the document through templates, while avoiding reworking the documents content.
   
2. Q. "How do I do I know if I have Ruby/Gems/Jekyll installed on my machine?"

   A. Open up a Command Line Terminal and run the corresponding command:
   
   ruby -v  
   gems -v  
   jekyll -v  
   
   If it is installed, you computer will output the currently installed version
